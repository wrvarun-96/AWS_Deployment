## **End-to-End Machine Learning Project and Deployment in AWS**

### **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the development of a scalable machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion to cloud-based deployment. The goal was to build an end-to-end system that automates data ingestion, model training, and real-time predictions using AWS services.

### **Key Features**

- **Automated Data Pipelines**:  
  Developed automated data ingestion and transformation pipelines to streamline data processing.

- **Model Training and Optimization**:  
  Trained various machine learning models, with Ridge Regression achieving the highest performance, resulting in an R² score of 0.88.

- **Cloud Deployment on AWS**:  
  1. Deployed the model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using EC2 for scalable, real-time predictions.  
  2. Integrated AWS services including EC2, ECR, and Elastic Beanstalk to ensure smooth cloud deployment.

- **CI/CD Integration**:  
  Implemented Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Git, ensuring seamless updates, scalability, and version control throughout the deployment process.

### **Technologies Used**

- **AWS Services**:  
  EC2, ECR, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, Lambda, SageMaker

- **Machine Learning**:  
  Ridge Regression, with R² score of 0.88

- **CI/CD**:  
  Git-based continuous integration and deployment pipeline
